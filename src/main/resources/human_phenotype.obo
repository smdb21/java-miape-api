comment: Palatal width is measured as the distance between the maxillary first permanent molar on the right and left sides, at the lingual cervical line, using a specific device. Palate width is typically assessed subjectively in routine clinical practice. Narrowing is often associated with a High palate, but this should be assessed and coded separately. Gingival overgrowth can give the impression of a narrow palate but should be distinguished and coded separately. The term gothic palate is used to indicate that the roof of the palate is not round but rather has an inverted V-shape, and therefore, only the upper part of the palate is narrow.

def: "Height of the palate more than 2 SD above the mean (objective) or palatal height at the level of the first permanent molar more than twice the height of the teeth (subjective)." [pmid:19125428]
comment: The measuring device for this assessment is described in (Hall JG, Froster-Iskenius UG, Allanson JE, Gripp K, Slavotinek A. 2006. Handbook of Normal Physical Measurements. 2nd edition. Oxford Medical, publishers). A high palate is often associated with a narrow palate. However, a narrow palate can easily give a false appearance of a high palate. Height and width of the palate should be assessed and coded separately. We do not recommend the subjective determination because this term can be overused and\napplied inaccurately.

comment: Adrenogenital syndrome is also known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which results from disorders of steroid hormone production in the adrenal glands leading to a deficiency of cortisol. The pituitary gland reacts by increased secretion of corticotropin, which in turn causes the adrenal glands to overproduce certain intermediary hormones which have testosterone-like effects.

This may interfere with the body's ability to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain, resulting in hydrocephalus. Dandy Walker cysts are formed during early embryonic development, while the brain forms. The cyst in the cerebellum typically has several blood vessels running through it connecting to the brain, thereby prohibiting surgical removal." [HPO:curators]

Pulmonic stenosis is often seen as a part of Fallot' s tetralogy, in which case the events leading to the formation of the overriding aorta are also believed to be a cause of the pulmonic stenosis. The pulmonic stenosis is the major cause of the malformations seen in patients with Fallot tetralogy, with the other associated malformations acting as compensatory mechanisms to the pulmonic stenosis. The degree of stenosis varies between individuals with TOF, and is the primary determinant of symptoms and severity.

The echocardiographic signs are thickening of the anterior right ventricular wall and the septum. Cavity size is usually normal, or slightly enlarged. In many cases there is associated volume overload present due to tricuspid regurgitation, in the absence of this, septal motion is normal. This feature can also be a component of the separat entity tetralogy of Fallot in which case it is generally agreed to be a secondary anomaly, as the level of hypertrophy generally increases with age."

The condition causes a variety of symptoms, but usually includes some degree of epilepsy or recurring seizures, and often affects the brain's ability to function on higher levels. Symptoms range from nonexistent to profound, in which case heterotopia can result in severe seizure disorder, loss of motor skills, and mental retardation." [HPO:curators]

Motor paralysis results from deficits of the upper motor neurons (corticospinal, corticobulbar, or subcorticospinal).

namespace: medical_genetics
alt_id: HP:0010649
def: "This term applies to all changes in bone mineralisation and or ossification which (depending on severity) can be seen on x-rays as a change in density and or structure of the bone. Changes may affect all bones of the organism, just certain bones or only parts of bones and include decreased mineralisation as may be seen in osteoporosis or increased mineralisation and or ossification as in osteopetrosis, exostoses or any kind of atypic calicfications of different origin and distribution. The overall amount of mineralisation of the bone-organ can be measured as the amount of matter per cubic centimeter of bones, usually measured by densitometry of the lumbar spine or hip. The measurements are usually reported as g/cm3 or as a Z-score (the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the patient's age and sex). Note that measurement with this method does not reflect local changes in other bones, and as such might not be correct with regard the hole bone-organ." [HPO:curators]

Conditions that loosen the PIP joint and allow it to hyperextend, for example conditions that weaken the volar plate, can produce a swan neck deformity of the finger. One example is rheumatoid arthritis. Another cause are conditions that tighten up the small (intrinsic) muscles of the hand and fingers, for example hand trauma or nerve disorders, such as cerebral palsy, Parkinson's disease, or stroke."

Recording electrodes are placed over the scalp, spine, and peripheral nerves proximal to the stimulation site. Clinical studies generally use electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves to elicit potentials. SSEP testing determines whether peripheral sensory nerves are able to transmit sensory information like pain, temperature, and touch to the brain. Abnormal SSEPs can result from dysfunction at the level of the peripheral nerve, plexus, spinal root, spinal cord, brain stem, thalamocortical projections, or primary somatosensory cortex."

def: "Any abnormal process of ossification of the metatarsal bones, which normally are each ossified from two centers: one for the body, and one for the head (metatarsal II,III,IV, and V) and one for the body and one for the base (metatarsal I). The ossification process begins in the center of the body about the ninth week, and extends toward either extremity. The center for the base of the first metatarsal appears about the third year, and the centers for the heads of the other bones between the fifth and eighth years. They join the bodies between the eighteenth and twentieth years." [HPO:curators]

Usually, pulsatile tinnitus is heard as a lower pitched thumping or booming, a rougher blowing sound which is coincidental with respiration, or as a clicking, higher pitched rhythmic sensation. Pulsatile tinnitus may be associated with vascular abnormalities such as arterioevenous shunts or glomus tumors or the jugular vein, arterial bruits related to a high-riding carotid artery (close to the auditory areas) or carotid stenosis, or venous abnormalities such as a dehiscent jugular bulb or to hypertension. Finally, in some patients, mechanical abnormalities such a spatulous eustachian tubes, palatomyoclonus (small spasms of muscles in the soft palate area), or idiopathic stapedial muscle spasm may represent the underlying cause of pulsatile tinnitus."

def: "This foot deformity is also known as rocker bottom feet (pes valgus), a rigid flatfoot deformity (as opposed to a flexible calcaneovalgus foot) caused by a malpositioned navicular bone at the neck of the talus; the ankle is in severe equinus and the forefoot in dorsiflexion, rocker bottom-like, accompanied by contraction of the talonavicular, deltoid and calcaneal cuboidal ligaments. The foot examination usually reveals a rigid foot with a \"reversed\" arch, a convex plantar surface, and a deep crease on the lateral dorsal side of the foot. The ankle joint is plantarflexed, while the midfoot and forefoot are extended upward. Lateral foot radiographs are helpful in confirming the diagnosis." [HPO:curators]

def: "Short or anteriorly attached lingual frenulum associated with limited mobility of the tongue." [pmid:19125428]
comment: The anterior third of the tongue is usually free or is partially attached to the floor of the mouth by the lingual frenulum. There is a spectrum ranging from fusion of the tongue to the floor of the mouth (ankyloglossia inferiorum) to a lingual frenulum that is short or anchored toward the tip of the tongue (sometimes called tongue tie). Ankyloglossia may be associated with a mild indentation of the tip of the tongue, which should not be coded as a Bifid tongue.

comment: Spinal dysraphism, or neural tube defect comprises a heterogeneous group of congenital spinal anomalies that result from defective closure of the neural tube early in fetal life and anomalous development of the caudal cell mass. The anatomic features common to the entire group is an anomaly in the midline structures of the back, especially the absence of some of the neural arches, and defects of the skin, filum terminale, nerves, and spinal cord. Open forms of spinal dysraphism include myelocele, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. These open forms are often associated with hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation type II and may be classified as spina bifida aperta. Closed forms of spinal dysraphism includ spina bifida occulta.

name: Ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve
namespace: medical_genetics
def: "Ebstein's anomaly refers to an abnormally placed and deformed tricuspid valve characterized by apical displacement of the septal and posterior tricuspid valve leaflets, leading to atrialization of the right ventricle with a variable degree of malformation and displacement of the anterior leaflet." [HPO:curators]
comment: Ebstein's anomaly is often associated with a hypoplastic right ventricle, patent foramen ovale, and a degree of cyanosis dependent on the amount if inadequacy of the tricuspid valve. Ebstein's anomaly may be associated with Wolf-Parkinson-White syndrome or other arrythmias.

def: "Elevated 7-dehydrocholesterol levels occur as the result of a deficiency of the enzyme delta-7-sterol reductase, the penultimate enzyme of mammalian sterol biosynthesis that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. This enzyme removes the C(7-8) double bond introduced by the sterol delta8-delta7 isomerases. In addition, its role in drug-induced malformations is known: inhibitors of the last step of cholesterol biosynthesis such as AY9944 and BM15766 severely impair brain development. Homozygous mutations in the gene encoding for this enzyme are the molecular genetic cause of Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome." [HPO:curators]

def: "An abnormal lack of stability of the cervical spine." [HPO:curators]
comment: The cervical spine is made up of two anatomically and functionally distinct segments: the upper cervical spine (C1and C2), which possesses the most rotational mobility with some degrees of frontal and sagittal plane mobility, and the lower cervical spine, which allows for two types of movements - flexion-extension and inclination-rotation. Cervical instability mainly involves the upper cervical spine, particularly between C1 and C2. Craniocervical ligaments are the main determinants of cervical spine stability.
